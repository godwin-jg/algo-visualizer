# Algorithms Visualiser

In this project, I have built a visualizer to visualize various Pathfinding and sorting algorithms using React. 
Dijkstra's algorithm, A* algorithm for the pathfinding algorithms. 
Merge sort, Quicksort, Heap sort, Bubble sort for the sorting algorithms.
### Getting started
run <br/>
`npm install` and then <br/>
`npm start`
