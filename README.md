# Algorithms Visulizer

In this project I have built a visualizer to visualize various Path finding and sorting algorithms using React. 
Dijkstra's algorithm, A* algorithm for the pathfinding algorithms. 
Merge sort, Quick sort, Heap sort, Bubble sort for the sorting algorithms.
### Getting started
run 
`npm install`
`npm start`
